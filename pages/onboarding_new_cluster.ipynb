    "# How to add a new cluster to Operate First\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will explore how to onboard a cluster to the Operate First community. This document covers a journey from a standalone cluster to cluster which is centrally managed by the Operate First Ops team via GitOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] The cluster which is being onboarded must already exist and run OpenShift.\n",
    "- [x] The cluster is imported to the Operate First's Advanced cluster management (ACM).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need help to fulfill either of the prerequisites, please raise an issue in the support repository [here](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] A pull request against the `operate-first/apps` repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PR enables the Operate First to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Operate First's ArgoCD can manage the cluster.\n",
    "- [ ] Operate First's SSO is used as identity provider by OpenShift.\n",
    "- [ ] Operate First's integrated metrics and alerting federation is deployed to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "All manifests for all the workloads owned by Operate First Ops team are maintained in the `operate-first/apps` repository following the [Kustomize best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cluster-scope` folder in this repo stores all privileged resources that are usually not allowed to be deployed by regular project admin and requires elevated access like cluster-admin role.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about the overall design please consult Operate First's [Architectural Decision Records (ADR) archive](https://www.operate-first.cloud/blueprints/blueprint/#architectural-decisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster we have a separate overlay in the `cluster-scope` folder. Clusters are grouped grouped by region. For more information on this topic, see [ADR-0009 - Declarative Definitions for Cluster Scoped Resources](https://www.operate-first.cloud/blueprints/blueprint/docs/adr/0009-cluster-resources.md).\n",

Once the app-of-apps resource manifest is created, we'll add it to the Kustomization at `argocd/overlays/moc-infra/applications/app-of-apps/kustomization.yaml`."
